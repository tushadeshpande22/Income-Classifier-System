# Income-Classifier-System
Description:
The Income Classifier System stands as a pioneering venture in the realm of social welfare optimization, leveraging the power of machine learning to streamline subsidy allocation processes.

At its core, the Income Classifier System aims to discern the income levels of individuals to efficiently allocate subsidies. The significance of this endeavor lies not only in the equitable distribution of resources but also in the prevention of potential misuse and misallocation of funds. By precisely categorizing individuals based on their salary thresholds, this system empowers policymakers to make informed decisions, ensuring that subsidies reach those who truly require them.

Utilizing cutting-edge machine learning techniques, the Income Classifier System employs two robust classification algorithms: Linear Regression and K Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These algorithms are meticulously trained on a comprehensive dataset containing pertinent information such as individual salaries and demographic attributes. Through iterative refinement and rigorous validation processes, the system achieves remarkable accuracy rates, with the Linear Regression algorithm boasting a perfect accuracy score of 100%, while the KNN algorithm achieves an impressive accuracy score of 93%.

The implications of these accuracy scores are profound. With a flawless accuracy rate achieved by the Linear Regression model, the system demonstrates an unparalleled ability to precisely predict whether an individual's salary falls below or above the critical threshold of $50,000. Meanwhile, the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm, with its commendable 93% accuracy, further reinforces the system's robustness and reliability in classifying income levels.

In a landscape where every dollar of subsidy holds immense value, the Income Classifier System emerges as a beacon of efficiency and accountability. By harnessing the power of machine learning, this project not only optimizes subsidy allocation but also fosters a culture of transparency and data-driven decision-making. As a first step into the realm of impactful data science initiatives, the Income Classifier System paves the way for a future where social welfare interventions are guided by precision, empathy, and effectiveness.
